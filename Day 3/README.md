# GANs with PyTorch

Today I am experimenting with PyTorch to finish my first assignment of GANs Specialisation offered by DeepLearning.AI.
I went through the lab which was a great introduction to the functions and _nn module_. I will strongly recommend to go through the notebook to understand all about training loop and other common terms one encounters while executing a PyTorch code.


#### Goal of the assignment
In this notebook, you're going to create your first generative adversarial network (GAN) for this course! Specifically, you will build and train __a GAN that can generate hand-written images of digits (0-9)__. You will be using PyTorch in this specialization, so if you're not familiar with this framework, you may find the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) useful. The hints will also often include links to relevant documentation.

#### Learning Objectives
1.   Build the generator and discriminator components of a GAN from scratch.
2.   Create generator and discriminator loss functions.
3.   Train your GAN and visualize the generated images.
