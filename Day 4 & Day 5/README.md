# DCGAN with PyTorch

I have previously explored DCGAN with Keras. In these two days, I will be working on DCGAN using PyTorch.
_Following official documentation is a habit that has been very useful to me as a developer. I used to follow blogs and over the time I started reading the official documentation for each library I used. It helped me learn a lot!_

So in our quest to master PyTorch, let us follow this awesome [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html) by PyTorch!
I intend to follow standard tutorials and projects for first 10 day before we switch to personal projects.
