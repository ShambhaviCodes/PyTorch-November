# Detecting COVID-19 with Chest X-Ray using PyTorch

Day 1 of my 25DaysOfPyTorch Challenge : I tried a Coursera Project. It was easy! 
And I am not so much out of practice with PyTorch. My suggestion would be to do the project without video assistance by yourself first. 

__Project Detail__ <br/>
We will use a ResNet-18 model and train it on a COVID-19 Radiography dataset. This dataset has nearly 3000 Chest X-Ray scans which are categorized in three classes - Normal, Viral Pneumonia and COVID-19. The objective in this project is to create an image classification model that can predict Chest X-Ray scans that belong to one of the three classes with a reasonably high accuracy.

The tasks include : 
- Introduction
- Importing Libraries
- Creating Custom Dataset
- Image Transformations
- Prepare DataLoader
- Data Visualization
- Creating the Model
- Training the Model
- Final Results
