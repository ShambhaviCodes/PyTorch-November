# Reviewing PyTorch Basics
After yesterday's Guided Project, I decided to revisit my concepts of tensors and broadcasting I had learnt during 'EECS 498-007/598-005'.

The notebook contains the following broad topics :
- Tensor Basics
- Tensor indexing
- Reshaping operations
- Tensor operations
- Broadcasting
- Running on GPU

I also found this amazing [blog](https://medium.com/@nikhilamunipalli/starter-pack-for-deep-learning-in-pytorch-for-extreme-beginners-by-a-beginner-330f3fdefcc4) for a quick walkthrough!
